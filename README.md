This is an Odin Project to build a basic recipe website. We have not 
touched CSS yet.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a 
few recipes.

I will have demonstrated the following skills:

1. Using GIT
2. Using Github
3. Cloning from GitHub
4. Commit messages
5. Some basic html
